# Machine Learning Operations - Lab assignments

- Student name: NAME
- Repository URL: <https://github.com/HOGENT-MLOps/USERNAME/REPO>

This repository contains the lab assignments for the course Machine Learning Operations, which is part of the [Bachelor Applied Computer Science programme](https://www.hogent.be/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/) at [HOGENT](https://www.hogent.be/).

The goal of these assignments is to get familiar with concepts like container virtualization, CI/CD, monitoring, etc. in the context of Machine Learning Operations.

This repository contains some scaffolding code, based on [vagrant-shell-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/vagrant-shell-skeleton/), a framework for quickly setting up an environment powered by [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

- [dockerlab](dockerlab/): sets up a VM to experiment with container virtualization.
